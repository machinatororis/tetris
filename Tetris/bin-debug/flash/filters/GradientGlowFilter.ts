	/**
	 * The GradientGlowFilter class lets you apply a gradient glow effect to display objects. A gradient glow is a realistic-looking 
	 * glow with a color gradient that you can control. You can apply a gradient glow around the inner or outer edge of an object 
	 * or on top of an object. You can apply the filter to any display object (objects that inherit from the DisplayObject class), 
	 * such as MovieClip, SimpleButton, TextField, and Video objects, as well as to BitmapData objects.
	 * 
	 * The use of filters depends on the object to which you apply the filter:
	 * 
	 *     To apply filters to display objects, use the filters property. Setting the filters property of an object does not modify 
	 * the object, and you can remove the filter by clearing the filters property.
	 *     To apply filters to BitmapData objects, use the BitmapData.applyFilter() method. Calling applyFilter() on a BitmapData object 
	 * takes the source BitmapData object and the filter object and generates a filtered image as a result.
	 * 
	 * If you apply a filter to a display object, the cacheAsBitmap property of the display object is set to true. If you clear all filters, 
	 * the original value of cacheAsBitmap is restored.
	 * 
	 * This filter supports Stage scaling. However, it does not support general scaling, rotation, and skewing; if the object itself is 
	 * scaled (if scaleX and scaleY are set to a value other than 1.0), the filter effect is not scaled. It is scaled only when the user 
	 * zooms in on the Stage.
	 * 
	 * A filter is not applied if the resulting image exceeds the maximum dimensions. In AIR 1.5 and Flash Player 10, 
	 * the maximum is 8,191 pixels in width or height, and the total number of pixels cannot exceed 16,777,215 pixels. 
	 * (So, if an image is 8,191 pixels wide, it can only be 2,048 pixels high.) In Flash Player 9 and earlier and AIR 1.1 and earlier, 
	 * the limitation is 2,880 pixels in height and 2,880 pixels in width. For example, if you zoom in on a large movie clip with a 
	 * filter applied, the filter is turned off if the resulting image exceeds the maximum dimensions.
