	/**
	 * The ConvolutionFilter class applies a matrix convolution filter effect. A convolution combines pixels in the input 
	 * image with neighboring pixels to produce an image. A wide variety of image effects can be achieved through convolutions, 
	 * including blurring, edge detection, sharpening, embossing, and beveling. You can apply the filter to any display object 
	 * (that is, objects that inherit from the DisplayObject class), such as MovieClip, SimpleButton, TextField, and Video objects, 
	 * as well as to BitmapData objects.
	 * 
	 * To create a convolution filter, use the syntax new ConvolutionFilter(). The use of filters depends on the object to which you 
	 * apply the filter:
	 * 
	 *     To apply filters to movie clips, text fields, buttons, and video, use the filters property (inherited from DisplayObject). 
	 * Setting the filters property of an object does not modify the object, and you can remove the filter by clearing the filters property.
	 *     To apply filters to BitmapData objects, use the BitmapData.applyFilter() method. Calling applyFilter() on a BitmapData object
	 *  takes the source BitmapData object and the filter object and generates a filtered image as a result.
	 * 
	 * If you apply a filter to a display object, the value of the cacheAsBitmap property of the object is set to true. 
	 * If you clear all filters, the original value of cacheAsBitmap is restored.
	 * 
	 * A filter is not applied if the resulting image exceeds the maximum dimensions. In AIR 1.5 and Flash Player 10, 
	 * the maximum is 8,191 pixels in width or height, and the total number of pixels cannot exceed 16,777,215 pixels. 
	 * (So, if an image is 8,191 pixels wide, it can only be 2,048 pixels high.) In Flash Player 9 and earlier and AIR 1.1 and earlier, 
	 * the limitation is 2,880 pixels in height and 2,880 pixels in width. For example, if you zoom in on a large movie clip with a 
	 * filter applied, the filter is turned off if the resulting image exceeds maximum dimensions.
