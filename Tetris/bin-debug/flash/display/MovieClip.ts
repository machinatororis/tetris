	/**
	 * The MovieClip class inherits from the following classes: Sprite, DisplayObjectContainer, InteractiveObject, DisplayObject, 
	 * and EventDispatcher.
	 * Unlike the Sprite object, a MovieClip object has a timeline.
	 * 
	 * >In Flash Professional, the methods for the MovieClip class provide the same functionality as actions that target movie clips. 
	 * Some additional methods do not have equivalent actions in the Actions toolbox in the Actions panel in the Flash authoring tool.
	 * 
	 * Children instances placed on the Stage in Flash Professional cannot be accessed by code from within the constructor of a parent 
	 * instance since they have not been created at that point in code execution. Before accessing the child, the parent must instead 
	 * either create the child instance by code or delay access to a callback function that listens for the child to dispatch its 
	 * Event.ADDED_TO_STAGE event.
	 * 
	 * If you modify any of the following properties of a MovieClip object that contains a motion tween, the playhead is stopped in that 
	 * MovieClip object: alpha, blendMode, filters, height, opaqueBackground, rotation, scaleX, scaleY, scale9Grid, scrollRect, transform, 
	 * visible, width, x, or y. However, it does not stop the playhead in any child MovieClip objects of that MovieClip object.
	 * 
	 * Note:Flash Lite 4 supports the MovieClip.opaqueBackground property only if FEATURE_BITMAPCACHE is defined. 
	 * The default configuration of Flash Lite 4 does not define FEATURE_BITMAPCACHE. To enable the MovieClip.opaqueBackground property 
	 * for a suitable device, define FEATURE_BITMAPCACHE in your project.
