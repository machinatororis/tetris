	/**
	 * The URLRequest class captures all of the information in a single HTTP request. URLRequest objects are passed to the load() 
	 * methods of the Loader, URLStream, and URLLoader classes, and to other loading operations, to initiate URL downloads. 
	 * They are also passed to the upload() and download() methods of the FileReference class.
	 * A SWF file in the local-with-filesystem sandbox may not load data from, or provide data to, a resource that is in the network sandbox.
	 * 
	 * By default, the calling SWF file and the URL you load must be in the same domain. For example, a SWF file at www.adobe.com 
	 * can load data only from sources that are also at www.adobe.com. To load data from a different domain, 
	 * place a URL policy file on the server hosting the data.
	 * 
	 * However, in Adobe AIR, content in the application security sandbox (content installed with the AIR application) is not restricted by 
	 * these security limitations. For content running in Adobe AIR, files in the application security sandbox can access URLs using 
	 * any of the following URL schemes:
	 * 
	 * http and https
	 * file
	 * app-storage
	 * app
	 * Content running in Adobe AIR that is not in the application security sandbox observes the same restrictions as 
	 * content running in the browser (in Flash Player), and loading is governed by the content's domain and any permissions granted in 
	 * URL policy files.
	 * 
	 * Note: App Transport Security is being introduced from Apple in iOS9, which doesnâ€™t allow unsecure connections 
	 * between App and Web services. Due to this change all the connections which are made to Unsecure web sites via Loader, 
	 * URLLoader will discontinue and not work due to App Transport Security. Please specify exceptions to the default behaviour 
	 * by adding keys to Info.plist in your app.
