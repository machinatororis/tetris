	/**
	 * The IEventDispatcher interface defines methods for adding or removing event listeners, 
	 * checks whether specific types of event listeners are registered, and dispatches events.
	 * Event targets are an important part of the FlashÂ® Player and Adobe AIR event model. 
	 * The event target serves as the focal point for how events flow through the display list hierarchy. 
	 * When an event such as a mouse click or a keypress occurs, 
	 * an event object is dispatched into the event flow from the root of the display list. 
	 * The event object makes a round-trip journey to the event target, which is conceptually divided into three phases: 
	 * the capture phase includes the journey from the root to the last node before the event target's node; 
	 * the target phase includes only the event target node; 
	 * and the bubbling phase includes any subsequent nodes encountered on the return trip to the root of the display list.
	 * 
	 * In general, the easiest way for a user-defined class to gain event dispatching capabilities is to extend EventDispatcher. 
	 * If this is impossible (that is, if the class is already extending another class), 
	 * you can instead implement the IEventDispatcher interface, create an EventDispatcher member, 
	 * and write simple hooks to route calls into the aggregated EventDispatcher.
