	/**
	 * The ApplicationDomain class is a container for discrete groups of class definitions. Application domains are used to partition 
	 * classes that are in the same security domain. They allow multiple definitions of the same class to exist and allow children to 
	 * reuse parent definitions.
	 * Application domains are used when an external SWF file is loaded through the Loader class. All ActionScript 3.0 definitions in 
	 * the loaded SWF file are stored in the application domain, which is specified by the applicationDomain property of the LoaderContext 
	 * object that you pass as a context parameter of the Loader object's load() or loadBytes() method. The LoaderInfo object also contains 
	 * an applicationDomain property, which is read-only.
	 * 
	 * All code in a SWF file is defined to exist in an application domain. The current application domain is where your main application runs.
	 * The system domain contains all application domains, including the current domain, which means that it contains all Flash Player classes.
	 * 
	 * Every application domain, except the system domain, has an associated parent domain. The parent domain of your main application's 
	 * application domain is the system domain. Loaded classes are defined only when their parent doesn't already define them. 
	 * You cannot override a loaded class definition with a newer definition.
	 * 
	 * For usage examples of application domains, see the ActionScript 3.0 Developer's Guide.
	 * 
	 * The ApplicationDomain() constructor function allows you to create an ApplicationDomain object.
